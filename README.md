# Cedar Frontend Take-Home Challenge 🌲

Welcome to the Cedar Frontend Take-Home Challenge! This project showcases a responsive user login page using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and a mock API to simulate the backend. Designed with attention to UI fidelity, responsiveness, and user interaction, it aims to provide a seamless login experience.

And help me to get the job :D

## Features 🌟

- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive user interface that matches the provided Figma mocks.
- **Mock Authentication:** Simulates user authentication to demonstrate form handling and validation.
- **Redirect on Success:** Redirects to a user management page upon successful login with specific credentials.
- **Inline Error Messages:** Displays validation errors directly in the form for immediate feedback.
- **Unit Tests:** Includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and functionality.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: The React framework for production, providing server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)**: A flexible and extensible form library for React, which minimizes re-renders and improves performance.
- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity, used for writing unit tests.
- **[Shadcn UI](https://shadcn.com/)** (hypothetical, replace with actual if different): A comprehensive UI toolkit that provides beautifully crafted components and tools to enhance UI/UX.
